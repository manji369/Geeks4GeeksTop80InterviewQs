Q51. Breadth First Traversal (or Search) for a graph is similar to Breadth
First Traversal of a tree (See method 2 of this post). The only catch here is,
unlike trees, graphs may contain cycles, so we may come to the same node again.
To avoid processing a node more than once, we use a boolean visited array. For
simplicity, it is assumed that all vertices are reachable from the starting
vertex.
For example, in the following graph, we start traversal from vertex 2. When we
come to vertex 0, we look for all adjacent vertices of it. 2 is also an
adjacent vertex of 0. If we donâ€™t mark visited vertices, then 2 will be
processed again and it will become a non-terminating process. A Breadth First
Traversal of the following graph is 2, 0, 3, 1.
