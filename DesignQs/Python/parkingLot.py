Qd1. Design a parking lot.


Assumptions by me:

1. A parking lot has multiple levels. Each level has multiple spots to park.
2. Three types of vehicles can be parked: Motorbikes, cars and buses.
3. Buses can only be parked in 3 continuous spots.
4. Cars and motorbikes can be parked in any of single spot.


Design:

1. Vehicle class from which cars, motorbikes and buses will inherit.
2. Only one class for spot. (has level and row as variables).
